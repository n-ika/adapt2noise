# Adaptation to speech in noise through selective attention

This repository contains the code for simulating the computational experiments of modeling selective attention.

All code was built in a conda environment with Python version 3.10.5 and TensorFlow version 2.8.2.

## Structure

* Folder `single_rdt` contains rate distortion theory implementation of selective attention to speech features, a paper submitted to CCN 2023 workshop.
* Folder `me_vae` containts code of further simulations of speech adaptation to situation/speaker.
