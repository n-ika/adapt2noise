# Speech features are weighted by selective attention

This repository contains the code for simulating the computational experiment of modeling selective attention to speech features.

Abstract:

*Listeners typically rely more on one aspect of the speech signal than another when categorizing speech sounds. This is known as feature weighting. We present a rate distortion theory model of feature weighting and use it to ask whether human listeners select feature weights sim- ply by mirroring the feature reliabilities that are present in their input. We show that there is an additional com- ponent (selective attention) listeners appear to use that is not reflected by the input statistics. This suggests that an internal mechanism is at play in governing listenersâ€™ weighting of different aspects of the speech signal, in addition to tracking statistics.*


## Dependencies

All model code was built in a conda environment with Python version 3.10.5 and TensorFlow version 2.8.2.

The dependencies needed to run this code:<br/>
`tensorflow`<br/>
`keras`<br/>
`itertools`<br/>
`scipy`<br/>
`sklearn`<br/>
`numpy`<br/>
`pandas`<br/>
`matplotlib`<br/>

## Run Experiment
To train and test the model:
`python rdt_single.py`

To test the model:
`python full_test_rdt.py`

To analyze the results and compare to human results (code in R):
`analysis.Rmd`

This repository is still in the process of work.
